Ok I need features. We need to have grade levels that can support up to, 12th grade.

0 - Kindergarten
1 - First Grade
2 - Second Grade
3 - Third Grade
4 - Fourth Grade
5 - Fifth Grade
6 - Sixth Grade
7 - Seventh Grade
8 - Eighth Grade
9 - Ninth Grade
10 - Tenth Grade
11 - Eleventh Grade
12 - Twelth Grade

Each grade will have 4 or 5 subjects.
Math, Reading, Science, Social Studies, and Language Arts.

So when we have all of these subjects, we can create our features.
