# Disclaimer

This disclaimer is given by the creator of this application.

This application source should not be tampered with by users using this application or software. This application will be spoiled if tampered with. See. This application has all your data in this application. You could turn on something which is not supposed to be turned on. Really.

This application has critical data and functionality used internally by the source code. This could spoil the application and the source code. You actually could destroy the source code or program completely, but if it is temporary, or fully. Ask a Parent, Teacher, Principal, or any other administrator, you could also ask a developer to provide you with information about turning the program on or off.

## Documentation

So this is a documentation about settings, data, and functionality. All of these settings or information is available in this folder, but should not be tampered with by users using this application or software. This should only be changed by developers or moderators, or just people who know this application very well, but if you play with this application or folder. There could be major consequences if you do that.

### Settings
---
Ok so now to the point. We have settings. It can be changed by the application. The configuration folder contains all settings. These settings are used by the source code so they can function the way you want.

In settings there are modes that can change the application functionally. Modes can be turned off or on. So the section below shows the modes that can be turned off or on. You can't have two modes at the same time or more than 1 mode.

1. Student Mode
2. Parent mode
3. Teacher Mode
4. Principal Mode

Each mode has its own level. So students don't really control anything actually. Except their account configuration and their password.

Well Parent Mode can see what their kid's account is doing and their settings. Parents can contact the kid's teacher, other teachers, and principal. I don't know if they can contact the superintendent, but that's it.

Teacher mode can contact Parents, teachers, principals, and superintendents. Teachers can control student accounts and their classroom settings. Well teachers can make homework and games for the students. They can teach lessons with using camera and microphone technologies.

Principal mode can contact Parents, teachers, other principals, and superintendents. Principal mode can fire a teacher only in the probation period. Principals can control students I guess. They're principals.

There is no such thing as a superintendent mode. Cause if there is. There might be problems.

So if you are on student mode. You cant really change your mode to higher modes. If you are in parent mode. You can change to student and parent mode. If you are in teacher mode. You can change to student, parent, and teacher mode. If you are in principal mode. You can change to student, parent, teacher, and principal mode. Well if you're in superintendent mode. Which is a mode. But not accessible by all the other modes. You can change to student, parent, teacher, principal, and superintendent mode.

Well all modes can change account stuff. You can delete accounts, change passwords of an account, change usernames, and change class, campus, and school district. But some of them are not accessible cause the teacher turning it off.

#### Source code
---

Well this part is about source code. Source code is essential to this program. If some source code is changed by a non developer. If could lead into, problems. So don't change the source code.

Well then how does the settings work? Well XML supports it. XML is used in a lot of programs. So yeah. Here is what xml looks like.

```
<xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8">
<main>
    <whatevs>
        <hi>hi</hi>
    </whatevs>
</main>
```

Well this very document is actually related to markdown. Which is actually related to html which is also related to xml. So I guess markdown is cousins with xml. Nevermind.

---
Well all programming languages are related to C++ and C. Why C++ and C? Most programming languages have similar syntax to C++ and C. Like python for example. That programming language actually is coded in C++ or C. Well other programming language are a mixup of two languages. Like C#, or C sharp. C# is a programming language made out of two. C++ and Java. It is used in many programs and editors like unity and that's it. That's all the editors I know that support C#. Well VS code supports it also.

### Data
Well ``data`` stores information. Here's what ``data`` looks like in a ``.log`` file.

```
16:33:21 - Started Assignment "Linear Equations
16:43:55 - Completed assignment "Linear Equations"
16:45:12 - Commented "This was really easy!" on "Linear Equations" as "David L."
16:46:12 - Started Assignment "Variables in Algebra"
```
